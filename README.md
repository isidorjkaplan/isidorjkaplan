## Projects

### Verilog 16-bit Processor
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/ProcessorPublic  
I created a Verilog 16-bit, 8-register, interrupt-enabled processor with a wide range of memory mapped I/O such as a VGA display and private timers. The processor can be synthethized on the DE1_SOC board or using the DESIM simulator. 

### Pipelined Verilog 16-bit Processor
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/PipelinedProcessor 
Designed a 5-stage pipelined processor in system-verilog running the same ARM-like assembly language as the above processor. 

### OVAL: Realtime Online-Learning Video Compression
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/OVAL
A autoencoder-based machine learning framework that trains in real-time during deployment to result in substantially improved video encodings. 

### CPillar
This was a massive peice of commercial software that I worked on during my employment with Rocscience Inc. I was responsible for refactoring the entire code-base. Due to the code being closed-source I cannot share the actual code. 

### OS161
Implemented core features in an open-source operating system including: Virtual Memory (paging, swapping, etc etc). Process Management (fork, execv, waitpid, exit)

### Mapper (C++ GIS)
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/MapperPublic   
I developed an interactive mapping program using Ezgl and Gtk graphics libraries. It supports a range of powerful features that allow you to transverse and navgiate the map. 

### Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/DRL   
An object-oriented framework that implements many of the common deep reinforcement learning algorithms and supports different neural network types. While I was working for the iQua research group I developed this framework which was used for our papers. Note that the framework itself does not represent the unique ideas in our papers and does not identify our papers. All of the algorithms in this repo are public algorithms such as Actor-Crtitic, DQN, and Cross-Entropy. 

### Insulator Fault Detection
This work was used in the research paper:
```
Hybrid Algorithm Based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning to Identify Ceramic Insulators and Detect Physical Damages,   
Youssef El Haj, Ruth Milman, Isidor Kaplan, Ali Ashasi. CEIDP 2021 (Accepted)
```
The research paper itself can be found [here](https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/insulators/blob/main/Hybrid%20Algorithm%20Based%20on%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20to%20Identify%20Ceramic%20Insulators%20and%20Detect%20Physical%20Damages.pdf) 
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/insulators <--- Newer version with cleaned up code and a few extra features
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/Metsco_Insulator_Detection <--- Original code that was used for the paper we submitted
While I was in first year I had a course project where I worked in collaboration with METSCO Inc to design a machine learning approach to identify insulators with visually-identifiable damage. Unfortunately the repo itself is not so organized as it was not part of our course submission, but attached to it is the final report for that project which is a ~20 page report along with a video and powerpoint explaining our design and giving a detailed analysis of metrics. 

### Ultra Minecraft Plugin
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/UltraPlugin     
While I was in Grade 11 and 12 I single-handedly created this 300+ class codebase in Java. It consists of a core library, reffered to as "UltraLib," which stores a set of useful libraries and types. I then used this library to create a large amount of independent modular plugins that share functionality through the core plugin. These can be found in the 'modules' and 'abandoned' folders.

### FCC Neural Network Java
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/neural-network-java     
A Java FCC Neural Network implementation I wrote as a personal project to introduce myself to machine learning. This primitive deep learning implementation supports vanilla backrpopogation to train a fully connected neural network. Tested on the MNIST database. 

### Reinforcement Learning Research Papers
I co-authored 3 papers while working for the iQua research group. Unfortunately, since the papers are under double-blind review I am prohibited from sharing the code or even describing the papers since they are being submitted to double-blind conferences and have not yet been approved. 

### Reversi AI: 
I implemented an MCTS + Reinforcement Learning model in C to play the board game Reversi. I ranked 5th in the class for a competition in a class of 300+ students. Unfortunately since this was a school assignment I am not permitted to share the code publicly because of academic integrity regulations (the assignment was just to implement a basic AI for Reversi, I went overboard)

### Galaxy-Explorer AI: 
In 2nd year for my Intro to C++ course (ECE244) I implemented an AI to play an atari-inspired game called Galaxy-Explorer. I used Machine Learning to tune the parameters of a powerful heuristic which was able to score 4th in the class. I cannot share the code for the same reason as the Reversi AI
