## A note to visitors
Unfortunately, I am restricted from publically sharing the code from the vast majority of projects I have worked on. Here are some of the projets that I have worked on but am not permitted from sharing the code. The code that I am allowed to share is on my Repo but it is not representitive of my best work. All of the projects I am most proud of I am not allowed to share the code for, which is extreamly unfortunate. 

# Reversi AI: 
I implemented an MCTS + Reinforcement Learning model in C to play the board game Reversi. I ranked 5th in the class for a competition in a class of 300+ students. Unfortunately since this was a school assignment I am not permitted to share the code publically beacuse of academic integrity regulations (the assignment was just to implement a basic AI for Reversi, I went overboard)
# Galaxy-Explorer AI: 
In 2nd year for my Intro to C++ course (ECE244) I implemented an AI to play an atari-inspired game called Galaxy-Explorer. I used Machine Learning to tune the parameters of a powerful heuristic which was able to score 4th in the class. I cannot share the code for the same reason as the Reversi AI
# Reinforcement Learning Research Papers
I co-authored 3 papers while working for the iQua research group. Unfortunately, since the papers are under double-blind review I am prohibited from sharing the code or even describing the papers since they are being submitted to double-blind conferences and have not yet been approved.
