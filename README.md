# Isidor Kaplan
## About me
Second-year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto with an interest in machine learning, programming, and software-design. On Dean’s List for all academic terms to date. Recipient of University of Toronto In-Course Scholarship and FASE First Year Summer Fellowship. Worked for the iQua research group and co-authored three (3) research papers on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## A note to visitors
Unfortunately, I am restricted from publically sharing the code from some of projects I have worked on. Here are some of the projets that I have worked on but am not permitted from sharing the code. The code that I am allowed to share is on my GitHub. 

### Reversi AI: 
I implemented an MCTS + Reinforcement Learning model in C to play the board game Reversi. I ranked 5th in the class for a competition in a class of 300+ students. Unfortunately since this was a school assignment I am not permitted to share the code publically beacuse of academic integrity regulations (the assignment was just to implement a basic AI for Reversi, I went overboard)
### Galaxy-Explorer AI: 
In 2nd year for my Intro to C++ course (ECE244) I implemented an AI to play an atari-inspired game called Galaxy-Explorer. I used Machine Learning to tune the parameters of a powerful heuristic which was able to score 4th in the class. I cannot share the code for the same reason as the Reversi AI
### Reinforcement Learning Research Papers
I co-authored 3 papers while working for the iQua research group. Unfortunately, since the papers are under double-blind review I am prohibited from sharing the code or even describing the papers since they are being submitted to double-blind conferences and have not yet been approved. 

## Some projects I can share
Below are some of the projects I can share. The GitHub repo's for these projects are pinned on my page. 

### Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/DRL
An object-oriented framework that implements many of the common deep reinforcement learning algorythems and supports different neural network types. While I was working for the iQua research group I developed this framework which was used for our papers. Note that the framework itself does not represent the unique ideas in our papers and does not identify our papers. All of the algorythems in this repo are public algorythems such as Actor-Crtitic, DQN, and Cross-Entropy. 

### Ultra Minecraft Plugin
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/UltraPlugin
While I was in Grade 11 and 12 I single-handidly created this 300+ class codebase in Java. It consists of a core library, reffered to as "UltraLib," which stores a set of useful libraries and types. I then used this library to create a large amount of independant modular plugins that share functionality through the core plugin. These can be found in the 'modules' and 'abandoned' folders.

### FCC Neural Network Java
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/neural-network-java 
A Java FCC Neural Network implementation I wrote as a personal project to introduce myself to machine learning. This primitive deep learning implementation supports vanilla backrpopogation to train a fully connected neural network. Tested on the MNIST database. 

### Insulator Fault Detection
https://github.com/isidorjkaplan/Metsco_Insulator_Detection
While I was in first year I had a course project where I worked in collaberation with METSCO Inc to design a machine learning aproach to identify insulators with visually-identifiable damage. Unfortunately the repo itself is not so organized as it was not part of our course submission, but attached to it is the final report for that project which is a ~20 page report along with a video and powerpoint explaining our design and giving a detailed analysis of metrics.
